public class Sqrt {
    /**
     * Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.
     *
     * You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.
     *
     * For example, do not use pow(x, 0.5) in c++ or x ** 0.5 in python.
     *
     *
     * Example 1:
     *
     * Input: x = 4
     * Output: 2
     * Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.
     * Example 2:
     *
     * Input: x = 8
     * Output: 2
     * Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.
     *
     *
     * Constraints:
     *
     * 0 <= x <= 231 - 1
     * @param x
     * @return
